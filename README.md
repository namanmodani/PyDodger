# PyDodger

Three-staged 3D real-time strategy game in Python on the PySoy cloud engine. Developed as task submissions to Copyleft Games during Google Code-in 2019.

- The player object is the wireframed sphere, positioned at coordinates (0, 0, 12).
- Using the inherent WASD key controls, the player is supposed to navigate through the various objects floating in the gameroom. The game ends when the player collides with any of the eight high-speed objects inside the room.
- The final score is a function of the time lasted by the player until the above occurs. The end score is displayed at the terminal and at the titlebar of the client window as an integer.
