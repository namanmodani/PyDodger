# PyDodger by AlphaThesis

# Purpose and aim of the game

The player is the wireframe sphere that is visible right in front of the user at the coordinates (0, 0, 12)

Using the inherent WASD key controls, the player is supposed to navigate through the various objects that are found to be floating in the room

The game ends when the player collides with any of the eight objects inside the room.

The final score is a function of the time lasted by the player until the above occurs. The end score is displayed at the terminal and at the titlebar of the client window as an integer.

# How to start the game?

1. Navigate to the folder containing PyDodger.py
2. Right click and open terminal. Run the command "python3 PyDodger.py" (excluding the double inverted commas)

When the game ends, check the titlebar of the client window for the player's final score.
